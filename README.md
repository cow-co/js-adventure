# Javascript Text Adventure

## A little adventure game, written in JavaScript

This is a small game, written in JS, using NodeJS on the backend (which handles just a small number of things, such as saving progress), and native ES6 on the frontend. No React or anything on the frontend (using this as a little bit of practice in ES6).

Some quick design points:

- Initial design will be as a text-based game
- May move to having some static backgrounds and inventory icons as dev progresses
- When progress is saved, the player will be given a unique string to use to reload that save
